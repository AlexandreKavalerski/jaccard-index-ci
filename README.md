# 📊 Jaccard Index Calculator for Innovation Culture Dimensions

This repository provides a Python-based implementation to compute the **Jaccard Index** for dimensions of **Innovation Culture**, derived from a **Systematic Literature Review (SLR)**. 🚀 The goal is to analyze the similarity between dimensions across different sources using the **Jaccard Index**, a metric commonly used to measure the similarity and diversity of datasets.

## 🌟 Features

- 📚 **Systematic Analysis**: Works with innovation culture dimensions extracted from SLR study.
- 🐼 **Pandas Integration**: Utilizes **Pandas** for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- 📈 **Jaccard Index Computation**: Calculates the Jaccard Index to quantify similarity between sets.
